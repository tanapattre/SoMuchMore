                <h2>Resource Highlight: <i>Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents</i> by Isabel Wilkerson</h2>
                <time datetime="2020-10-15"> 15 October 2020</time>
                <p>Isabel Wilkerson’s latest book provides a timely re-thinking of American history and society and is a good read for any teacher looking to engage in anti-racist teaching (ie. all teachers). However, Caste actually delivers small chapters which may be ideal for use in various 9-12 classrooms.</p>
                <table>
                    <caption>Here is the list of chapters that I think may make for good reading and discussion.</caption>

                            <td>This chapter makes a comparison between the festering inequalities of American society and the ancient-world pathogens frozen in the permafrost that have begun to thaw as a result of climate change. May be useful when covering ecology and teaching systems-level and analogical thinking.</td>

                            <td>For a more advanced group of ESL students, this section allows the class to tease out the nuances of the “race” word specifically in an American context. For an English class, this snippet opens up the floor for discussing connotations, stereotypes, and intertextual asymmetries.</td>

                            <td>Another chapter that discusses race and biology. Specifically it teases out the difference between biologically defined genetic inheritance and a societally defined inheritance. Good setup for broader discussion of science and society.</td>

                <h2>Use Stories to Integrate Real-World Issues in Algebra</h2>
                    <time datetime="2020-09-30"> 30 September 2020</time>
                    <p>Surveys on how K12 students feel about math (cite 1 source). One solution may be to make students feel like math is relevant to their lives (cite a study that talks about inspiring motivation). How do we do this? We often use stories to set the context. We show examples of how math can be used in the real world. But word problems are hated. At least that's what I thought. I thought students hated word problems because they found them difficult. In actuality, word problems just did not jive well with what students are taugth to think of when they think of math.</p>
                    <p>Explain the article. Contrary to what one might think, students in a geometry class performed better on world problems than they did on regular problems. Students find word problems easier (cite and explain, Koedinger article, ~1 quick paragraph). Cite a few articles that agree with this.</p> 
                    <p>So where does this get us? (How do math teachers usually teach with word problems? Regardless, what this says is that we shouldn't be afraid of teaching word problems. Actually, because they potentially provide a frame of reference for our students, a way for them to connect math with the real world and their lives, we should embrace them. Research about using stories and making connections (cite and explain, be careful to use behavioral studies ~1 quick paragraph).</p>
