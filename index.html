                <h3>Resource Highlight: <i>Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents</i> by Isabel Wilkerson</h3>
                <time datetime="2020-10-15"> 15 October 2020</time>
                <p><a href="https://www.isabelwilkerson.com/" title="Isabel Wilkerson's website">Isabel Wilkerson’s</a> latest book provides a timely re-thinking of American history and society and is a good read for any teacher looking to engage in anti-racist teaching (ie. all teachers). However, Caste actually delivers small chapters which may be ideal for use in various 9-12 classrooms.</p>
                <table>

                <h3>Use Stories to Integrate Real-World Issues in Algebra</h3>
                    <time datetime="2020-09-30"> 30 September 2020</time>
                    <p>We know math causes anxiety in many of our students. Some experience it even in elementary school<sup>1</sup>. One way that we can potentially alleviate math anxiety is by relating math to students' own lives<sup>2</sup>. How do we do this? We might use stories and word problems! Through stories and word problems, we show examples of how math can be used in the real world.
                    But word problems are hated! At least that's what my students told me. In my admittedly limited experience, I found that there are some right ways to teach with word problems and some terrible ways to teach with word problems.</p>
                    <p>Interestingly, research by Koedinger and Nathan found that students actually performed better on world problems than they did on regular problems<sup>3</sup>. So where does this get us? Anyone who's taught a math class will immediately be able to recall situations where word problems have clicked with students and situations where word problems stumped them. Clearly there's an art to it that is hard to capture. Regardless, what this says is that we shouldn't be afraid of teaching word problems because of their potential to make math easier and to more relevant. Done well, word problems provide a frame of reference for our students, a way for them to connect math with the real world and their lives.</p>
                    
                    <p>Here are two quick examples from my own experience: one where I used word problems and caused frustration and anxiety and another where I used word problems that seemed to humanize math.</p>

                    <h4>Example 1</h4>
                    <p>For a few weeks, I decided to not assign regular math problems for our Algebra II class's weekly homework and instead assign roughly the same number of word problems. My students hated them. They complained and begrudgingly did the homework. When we got to class, I would notice a difference in my students' affect that made it harder for me to teach them.</p>

                    <h4>Example 2</h4>
                    <p>When we transitioned to online learning, I decided to come up with a character (Kamala) whose made-up life the students will track as they learn about various math topics. Each week, the students learned about a new type of function and applied it to something in Kamala's life. In one week, Kamala had to figure out how many classes she has to take to graduate but not spend more than she can pay for. The students used inverse functions. In another week, the students had to help Kamala figure out how many new streetlights to install in a small city and still maintain a minimum level of brightness at any given point on any street. The students had to use rational functions to work out the ideal distance between different streetlights. In both situations, we had nuance, guesswork, and uncertainty. Students had to make decisions about what type of streetlight to use and how many to install. Students were asked to make Kamala decide between taking more classes to graduate on time but losing out on income or not graduate on time and be able to keep the same number of work hours. By self-report, students showed that they were able to connect with at least some of the situations and found enjoyment in doing them. By my own grading, I noticed an uptick in engagement and the quality of answers. It seemed that in toning back the dosage of word problems, I was able to get more students to engage with them.</p>

                    <h4>Takeaways</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We should definitely be using word problems.</li>
                        <li>While a healthy dose of practice is a crucial component of any math class, less seems to get you more at least when it comes to word problems.</li>
                        <li>Students need to be taught how to do word problems. This is both possible and necessary because it can help them better learn the subject and also come to like math.</li>
                    </ul>
