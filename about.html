        <h1>So Much More</h1>
            <p>I am what time, circumstance, history, have made of me, certainly, but I am, also, much more than that. So are we all. - <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/james-baldwin-about-the-author/59/" title="Who was James Baldwin?" target="_blank">James Baldwin</a>, <i>Notes of a Native Son</i></p>

                <h2>What is this website?</h2>

                <h2>Why the name?</h2>
                <p>In search of a better world for all, a teacher enables their students to become more than what "time, circumstance, history" made of them. Indeed, only by enabling students to be so "much more" can the teacher presume to shape the future through their craft. What are "time, circumstance, history" shaping our students into? What can we do to make sure our students are so "much more" than the products of their "time, circumstance, history"? How are we as teachers more than the products of our own "time, circumstance, history"? Thus, the work of a teacher mandates constant self-examination.</p>
